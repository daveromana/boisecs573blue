Here is the list of changes Dr Xu suggested during review.

- Revise title of Object Diagram to be "Class" Diagram (Mike)

- Rethink the current Drawing panel/Simulation buttons

- Revise the steps for Copy/Paste/Delete: select object(s) first,
then select the action; to allow operations on multiple objects
at the same time.

- Rethink the Arc/Arrow design: functionality is good but need
to signal what the program is doing.

- While preventing the creation of two lines between P1 to T1,
add acceptance criterion and report error message.

- Add icons to tool bar and hint text

- Add move functionality to reposition A, P, T1

- When deleting P/T delete arcs.

- Find class auto-diagramming tool (Eclipse plug-in?)

- Test names of P, T in various formats, e.g., include comments.

- See how Mista handles multi-language.

Mike's addition--include Mike in the java coding team.
